Some scripts that may, for example, be useful in finding a replication origin. 
Replication is performed by DNA polymerase and the initiation occurs when  the dnaA box binds to the DNA. 
The sequence where the dnaA box adheres to is very specific and usually about 9nt long. Since there are many genes along the strand of DNA, once can expect that the dnaA
box would appear many times. Given this, if we search a DNA sequence for the most frequent sequences that are 9nt long then we can assume that one of these may be
the dnaA box. Also, remember to take the reverse complement into consideration! These may increase the counts of the 9nt sequences that we see. If we find the reverse complement then we can safely add that to the count of our most frequent sequences. 

Finding this replication origin is important becuase this knowledge assists in technologies such as gene therapy, which allows viral vectors to replicate effectively. 

I wrote a few scripts that may help find the ori, some being more useful than others and some more preliminary than others. Let me know if you have any input, thank you!
